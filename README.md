# Calculator Project

The job was to build a calculator app using conditionals - if and else.

## Tasks performed to achieve this project

- The users are able to:
    - Practice basic operations by answering different questions
    - See the positive or negative result of their answer on the screen

## Extra task

- I implemented a randomly generated mathematical operation where both the numbers and the operator are generated in a random fashion. The user have to give the correct answer! This way they can practice their mathematical skills :D
